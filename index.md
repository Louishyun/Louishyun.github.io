### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 marked my first foray into C++ programming on Github. Looking back, the scope of the lab was relatively limited compared to more recent assignments. Despite its simplicity, it took me nearly an hour to complete a basic code and upload it to Github. Today, I am capable of handling far more complex tasks. Reflecting on the progress I've made over the semester, it's remarkable to see how much I've grown. Lab 1 will always hold a special place in my memory as the starting point of this journey.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 stands out as my favorite lab this semester. This time, I had the added benefit of two partners, making our team larger by one. Coding the Blackjack and Hi-Lo games proved to be an enjoyable challenge. We grappled with the while loop, which occasionally led to an infinitely looping code. Although this presented initial difficulties, we managed to overcome them and complete the assignment. The experience was a test of our problem-solving skills and teamwork, and we triumphed together.

* Lab 11

    As we approach the final week of lab classes, Lab 11 stands as a notable milestone in my learning journey. Working on this lab, I encountered the challenge of dealing with several files, including source files, header files, and CSV data files. It required a keen understanding of how these files interact with each other and the role each plays in the broader program. However, overcoming these challenges and successfully getting the program to run and pass all tests was incredibly rewarding. It reaffirmed my understanding of the fundamentals of C++ programming and my ability to work with more complex, multi-file projects.
